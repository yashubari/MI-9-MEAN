        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p style=font-size:120%>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b>
            <br>
            <b><em>Larry Page</em></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><em>Sergey Brin,</em></b> a student
            there, was assigned to show him around.</p>

            By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
            year they struck a <span style=background-color:purple>partnership.</span>
            <br>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
            individual pages on the <span style="color:blue">world Wide Web </span>.
            <br>
            They called this search engine <i style=background-color:yellow>Backrub.</i>
